              From 2019 - 2021 I was part of the CodersCrew organisation, in the
              UX/UI team. CodersCrew is a non-profit organization based in
              Wroclaw, Poland that is constantly evolving to create a community
              where people become IT-ready. There are a lot of passionate people
              out there ready to create amazing things together for free and in
              their free time that can help others.

            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>
              CodersCrew is getting bigger and bigger. Communication is via
              Slack, emails, Google Docs, Jira. However, there is need of a
              platform to get more organised. In the future, the website is to
              be available to other non-profit organisations to help them
              manage. Work on the website started on the UX side, under the
              supervision of the Project Manager with the cooperation of the
              developers and with the help and supervision of the client
              (board).

            <h1>Approach</h1>
            <p>
              Thanks to the platform- CodersBoard, the management board of the
              organization will be able to add members, check payments statuses
              for membership fees, and approve new projects. Members will be
              able to create their own profile, join projects, check projects
              progress and build their business history from initiatives in
              which they are participating in.

              I haven’t been in the project from the begginig. I marked with

              with a team of 5 people, but along the way the situation changed
              dynamically. The team shrank to 3 people, then there was only me
              and two new people.

            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>
              To begin with, we did a survey of current CoderCrew members and
              interviewed members of the association who have been in the
              organisation for a short and long time.
            </p>
            <p>Main conclusions from the surveys and interviews:</p>
            <p>
              - the section on projects, presentation of projects, description
              will be important<br />
              - users have trouble finding information on meeting dates,<br />
              - people do not know the leaders of the departments, they don’t
              know to whom to report on various matters<br />
              - a guide or mentor would be useful to introduce the new member to
              the association structure

            <h1>Event Storming</h1>
            <p>
              The event storming took place with the entire project team and the
              management board of the association. Thanks to this, it was
              possible to think together what activities we would like to see in
              the platform first.
            </p>
            <p>
              Several of the most important user paths were analyzed:<br />
              - Inviting people to CodersCrew<br />
              - Removing a member from the association<br />
              - Submitting and creating a new project
            </p>
            <p>Conclusions:</p>
            <p>
              The most important thing for users and admins is adding new
              members to association, a view of all tools/programs that are used
              in the association and a list of actual projects and people who
              participate in them and their skills.

            <h1>User Journey Maps</h1>
            <p>
              User Journey Maps were created based on evenstorming. Individual
              steps in the user, actions related to a given step and channels by
              which these actions are performed have been identified.
            </p>
            <p>Six maps were created:</p>

            <p>Five User Flow were created:</p>

            <p>
              Thanks to the User Flows, the vision of individual screens to be
              designed began to clarify. To prepare for this, an information
              architecture was created.
            </p>
            <p>Six diagrams were created:</p>
            <p>
              - Members list for admin<br />
              - Account settings for a new member<br />
              - Members list tab for a new member and a member<br />
              - Design tab for the admin<br />
              - Projects tab for a member<br />
              - Structure of application for CoderCrew
            </p>
            <p>
              As you can see there is three different paths: for a person during
              the trial period who wants to be a member, for a member and for an
              admin That is why the platform needs to have 3 different
              authorization systems.

            our organizations is what we do in our spare time for free, that is

            <h4>Mockups</h4>
            <p>
              Creating high fidelity mockups was really fun. We are working in a
              scrum system and meeting with clients (management) to discuss
              about interfaces. After preparing the mockups, we started
              preparing prototypes for testing. But... in the process our design
              team changed completely, the current people left and two others
              came, quite beginners in the UI. It was a big challenge to
              introduce new people and give them direction.
            </p>
            <h4>Prototypes and Usability Tests</h4>
            <p>
              We tested two people out of our association (potencials members),
              and two people from the association using sketches (wireframes).
              The tests were conduted online. I was an observer at one of the
              test, that was really great and refreshing experience.The form of
              the usability tests was based on a book: “Don't Make Me Think” by
              Steve Krug.

          <p>
            On the basis of the tests, we drew conclusions and prioritised
            improvements and changes. At the same time, we worked with the
            front-ends to program the finished functionalities, designed and
            tested the next flow. And that is how the CodersBoard website came
            into being.
